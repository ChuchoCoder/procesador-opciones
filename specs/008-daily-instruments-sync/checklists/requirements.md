# Specification Quality Checklist: Daily Instruments Sync

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-25
**Feature**: ../spec.md

## Content Quality

- [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [ ] Focused on user value and business needs
- [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [ ] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable
- [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [ ] Edge cases are identified
- [ ] Scope is clearly bounded
- [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [ ] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results (first pass)

Content Quality:

- No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs): PASS — spec avoids frameworks and implementation-specific APIs.
- Focused on user value and business needs: PASS — P1 story prioritizes user value.
- Written for non-technical stakeholders: PASS — language is business-oriented.
- All mandatory sections completed: PASS — User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Key Entities provided.

Requirement Completeness:

- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain: PASS — no markers used; assumptions documented.
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain: PASS — 3 clarifications have been resolved with product choices: scheduling-trigger (sync after 09:45 ART), localStorage policy (segment into multiple keys), data-ttl (until next trading day).
- Requirements are testable and unambiguous: PASS — each FR maps to acceptance scenarios/tests.
- Success criteria are measurable: PASS — includes measurable items (percentages, times).
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic: PASS — user-facing metrics used.
- All acceptance scenarios are defined: PARTIAL — primary flows defined; consider adding more negative/timeout scenarios.
- Edge cases are identified: PARTIAL — main edge cases included; may add browser storage-exceeded handling in more detail.
- All acceptance scenarios are defined: PARTIAL — primary flows defined; negative/timeout and retry/backoff failure modes should be added in planning.
- Edge cases are identified: PARTIAL — main edge cases included; localStorage quota handling is intentionally left as a clarification (FR-011).
- Scope is clearly bounded: PASS — scope limited to daily fetch, localStorage usage, fallback behavior.
- Dependencies and assumptions identified: PASS — assumptions section added.

Feature Readiness:

- All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria: PASS — acceptance scenarios accompany main stories.
- User scenarios cover primary flows: PASS — P1/P2/P3 provided.
- Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria: PASS — criteria defined; verification in testing section.
- No implementation details leak into specification: PASS

## Clarifications resolved

The following product decisions were provided and applied to the spec:

1. **FR-010** - scheduling-trigger: Sync must run at least once per calendar day after 09:45 AM Argentina (ART). App should attempt a scheduled sync at 09:45 ART when open; otherwise perform a check at next startup and sync if today's fetch is missing.
2. **FR-011** - localstorage-policy: Use segmentation (multiple keys) to store large payloads using a known prefix (`instrumentsWithDetails.part.<n>`); recomposition happens at read time.
3. **FR-012** - data-ttl: TTL set to "until next trading day" (market-aware). Outside market days no forced refresh until next trading day.

## Notes / Next Steps

- Consider adding explicit handling guidance for localStorage quota exceeded (segmenting or skipping save) during planning.
- Add CI integration test mocks for Broker API responses (success, partial data, malformed entries) as part of planning.
