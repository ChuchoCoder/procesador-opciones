# Auto-Detection Requirements Checklist: Simplified Processor UI

**Purpose**: Quick self-check for spec author focusing on auto-detection logic requirements clarity
**Created**: 2025-10-11
**Feature**: ../spec.md

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are all token inference inputs (explicit symbol/expiration, token components) enumerated for every branch of the enrichment logic? [Completeness, Spec §FR-004–FR-006]
- [ ] CHK002 Does the spec state what happens when both explicit fields and token fields disagree (precedence rules)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-004, Clarifications §Session 2025-10-11]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK003 Are the normalization rules (uppercase symbol/expiration, numeric strike precision) stated unambiguously with measurable outcomes? [Clarity, Spec §FR-016–FR-017]
- [ ] CHK004 Is the detection regex definition precise enough (character classes, optional groups) to reproduce without guessing? [Clarity, Spec §FR-004]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK005 Do the enrichment rules for non-option rows align between Functional Requirements and Clarifications (e.g., placeholder expiration NONE) without contradictions? [Consistency, Spec §FR-022, Clarifications §Session 2025-10-11]
- [ ] CHK006 Are success criteria SC-002/SC-003 consistent with FR-006 and FR-015 handling inferred vs. preserved rows? [Consistency, Spec §SC-002–SC-003 & FR-006, FR-015]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK007 Can SC-002 (100% enrichment accuracy) be objectively measured with defined sample size and false-positive tolerance? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §SC-002]
- [ ] CHK008 Do measurable outcomes cover both inferred and non-inferred rows to validate deterministic classification? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §SC-002–SC-003]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK009 Are scenarios with mixed explicit/missing fields covered in acceptance tests and edge cases so each branch of detection is represented? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 1, Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK010 Are single-symbol non-option datasets explicitly covered to ensure grouping logic still functions? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases, FR-022]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK011 Are malformed tokens, decimal strikes, and lowercase inputs all called out with expected outcomes? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases, FR-017]
- [ ] CHK012 Is the UNKNOWN::UNKNOWN fallback behavior defined for rows missing both symbol and expiration? [Edge Case, Spec §Assumptions #1]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK013 Are performance targets for enrichment (≤100 ms typical) clearly tied to the detection logic path? [NFR, Spec §NFR-001, FR-021]
- [ ] CHK014 Is deterministic behavior under Principle 3 captured so test-before-change expectations are met? [NFR, Spec §NFR-003, Constitution Principle 3]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK015 Are assumptions about token formats (e.g., presence of strike/series) documented so future CSV changes can be evaluated? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions #2–#5]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK016 Does the spec avoid ambiguous terms like "unknown" by defining exact placeholder values and metadata flags? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-006, FR-015, Clarifications]

## Notes

- Use this checklist before `/speckit.plan` revisions or implementation to tighten requirement language.
- Mark non-applicable items with a note explaining why.
