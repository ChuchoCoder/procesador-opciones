# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `009-marketdata-ws` | **Date**: 2025-10-25 | **Spec**: `specs/009-marketdata-ws/spec.md`
**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/009-marketdata-ws/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Add a client-side Market Data WebSocket handler for the browser extension frontend to subscribe to broker market-data streams (`Md`) and expose a normalized internal API for UI consumers. The implementation will live in `frontend/src/services/broker/jsrofex-client.js` and use the native WebSocket API (no new runtime dependencies). Key behaviors: authenticated connection using session token, batched subscriptions via `smd`, entry filtering and depth control, deduplication, automatic reconnection with exponential backoff, and a small set of unit tests (Vitest) to validate core behaviors.

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: JavaScript (ES2020+) — repository frontend uses modern ES and Vite; implementation will be plain JS module compatible with the existing bundler.
**Primary Dependencies**: None new. Use native WebSocket API and existing project utilities. Avoid adding external libraries per Constitution Principle 4.
**Storage**: Ephemeral in-memory subscription state; persistent preferences (if added) via `chrome.storage.local` or `localStorage` following existing patterns in `frontend/src/services/storage`.
**Testing**: Vitest (project already includes Vitest in `frontend/package.json`); unit tests for connection/reconnect, subscription handling, message parsing and deduplication.
**Target Platform**: Chrome/Chromium extension environment (Manifest V3) — frontend (browser) context.
**Project Type**: Web extension frontend service (existing `frontend/` directory).
**Performance Goals**: Process incoming `Md` messages with p95 latency < 500ms for UI propagation under reasonable network/CPU conditions; minimize CPU/memory overhead for large subscription lists.
**Constraints**: Must follow Constitution (no new heavy deps, Spanish UI strings centralized, tests when requested). Token handling must consider browser WebSocket limitations (cannot set custom headers): use `wss://` by default and prefer header-based token delivery when supported by the server; if a query-parameter token is required, document the justification and mitigations in `research.md` (do not log tokens, use short-lived tokens, avoid embedding tokens in persistent links).
**Scale/Scope**: Support typical user subscriptions (dozens to low hundreds of instruments) in the browser; document behavior / degenerate cases for mass-subscription.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Gates (derived from constitution v2.0.1):

- Strings centralization (Principle 5): This feature adds user-visible diagnostic toasts/log labels (e.g., connection state messages) and will add Spanish strings to `frontend/src/strings/marketdata-strings.js` (es-AR). All strings will use the existing string module pattern in `frontend/src/strings/`.
- Parsing & Idempotence (Principle 2 & Technical Constraints 8): No new option parsing logic modifies existing option transforms. WebSocket message parsing will be implemented as pure parsing functions in `frontend/src/services/broker/parsers.js` with unit tests (Vitest) for idempotence and edge cases.
- Dependency policy (Principle 4): No new runtime dependency will be introduced. Justification: native WebSocket and small helper functions satisfy the feature; adding a websocket library would increase bundle size and is unnecessary for the targeted scope.
- Minimal Surface (Principle 1): End-user outcome: live market data subscription for UI widgets (books, charts). The change is focused and does not introduce broad abstractions; any utility promoted will follow the "promote after reuse twice" rule specified in the constitution.

GATE: Must pass. If any of the above change (e.g., new dependency added), update this section with justification and re-run the gate.

  real paths (e.g., apps/admin, packages/something). The delivered plan must

```

**Structure Decision**: Implement the Market Data client as a frontend service module and tests:

```
frontend/
└── src/
  └── services/
    └── broker/
      ├── jsrofex-client.js        # main WebSocket client implementation (FR-013)
      ├── parsers.js               # pure parsing + deduplication helpers
      └── __tests__/               # Vitest unit tests
```

Rationale: keeps implementation colocated with frontend consumers and follows existing repo layout.

| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
