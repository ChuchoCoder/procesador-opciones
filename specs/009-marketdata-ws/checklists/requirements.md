- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria

- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

Validation run: 2025-10-25

Summary: The spec addresses mandatory sections: user scenarios, parsed concepts, functional requirements, entities, success criteria and assumptions. No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were necessary given the detailed input. Remaining items to decide in planning: token renewal mechanics for WebSocket auth, exact backoff parameters (defaults suggested in FR-010), and maximum advisable subscription size per connection.

Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
