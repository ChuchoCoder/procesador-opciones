# Implementation Plan: Procesador Opciones SPA Migration

**Branch**: `001-feature-migrate-popup` | **Date**: 2025-10-10 | **Spec**: `specs/001-feature-migrate-popup/spec.md`
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-feature-migrate-popup/spec.md`

## Summary

Migrate the existing popup-based CSV operations processor into an offline-capable React 18 single-page application that uses Material UI for layout, papaparse for CSV ingestion, and browser storage for configuration persistence while preserving deterministic processing, localization, and performance guarantees.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: JavaScript (ES2020+) with React 18  
**Primary Dependencies**: React 18, Material UI v5, papaparse, Vite 5.x  
**Storage**: `localStorage` (browser) for persisted configuration  
**Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library + @testing-library/user-event  
**Target Platform**: Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge) running standalone SPA  
**Project Type**: Web SPA (frontend-only)  
**Performance Goals**: CSV processing ≤100ms for ≤500 rows; UI ready <150ms; warn when >25k rows  
**Constraints**: Offline processing only; bundle size increase must remain minimal; no Chrome extension APIs; Spanish (es-AR) UI strings centralized  
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user, single-screen workflow with two primary tabs (Processor, Settings)

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- Principle 1: Feature delivers the migrated SPA enabling CSV processing for end users; no infrastructural-only work planned.
- Principle 2: Processing pipeline will remain in pure utility modules (to be covered by unit tests) separated from React components.
- Principle 3: For consolidation and filtering logic, plan to author failing unit tests (e.g., `processOperations.spec.ts`) before refactors.
- Principle 4: Bundle impact monitored by measuring build artifacts; processing complexity analyzed for 50k-row upper bound with warning UX.
- Principle 5: Introducing minimal tooling only—standardizing on Vite 5 + Vitest per research—while avoiding extra libraries beyond Material UI + papaparse.
- Principle 6: All UI copy will be authored in Spanish (Argentina) and centralized in a strings module consumed via React context/hooks.

**Re-evaluation (2025-10-10):** Post-design review confirms all gates remain satisfied with the Vite/Vitest stack, offline-only constraint, and planned test coverage.

**Structure Decision**: Adopt a dedicated `frontend/` SPA workspace with React component, service, state, and localization directories plus a top-level `tests/` folder aligned with unit vs integration coverage.
