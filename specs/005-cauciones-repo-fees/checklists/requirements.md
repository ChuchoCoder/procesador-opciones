# Specification Quality Checklist: Cauciones (Repo) Fees & Expenses

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-16  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment

✅ **PASS** - Specification uses business terminology (colocadora, tomadora, expense breakdown, net settlement) without mentioning React, localStorage implementation details, or specific UI frameworks. All sections focus on user needs and business outcomes.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

✅ **PASS** - All 30 functional requirements are testable (e.g., FR-003 specifies exact formula, FR-014 specifies exact behavior for edge cases). No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present. Success criteria use measurable metrics (2 seconds, 0.01 tolerance, 95% accuracy, 80% reduction). Edge cases comprehensively identified.

### Feature Readiness Assessment

✅ **PASS** - User stories are prioritized (P1-P3), independently testable, and include clear acceptance scenarios. Requirements map to success criteria. Scope is bounded to Compra/Venta processors for Cauciones instruments with RP CFICODE prefix.

## Notes

Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan` phase. All checklist items passed on first validation iteration.

**Key Strengths**:

- Comprehensive formula specifications enable unambiguous implementation
- Role-based calculation logic clearly differentiated (lender vs borrower)
- Currency-specific requirements (ARS/USD) well-defined
- Edge case handling explicitly documented
- Success criteria measurable and user-focused
