# UI Improvements Summary - Arbitraje de Plazos

## Date: October 19, 2025

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Plazo Calculation Bug ✅

**File:** `frontend/src/services/data-aggregation.js`

**Problem:** Plazo was showing as 0 due to incorrect use of `Math.min()` on Date objects.

**Solution:** Convert dates to timestamps first, then find minimum:
```javascript
// Before (incorrect)
const earliestDate = new Date(Math.min(...dates.ciDates, ...dates.h24Dates));

// After (correct)
const allTimestamps = [...dates.ciDates, ...dates.h24Dates];
const earliestTimestamp = Math.min(...allTimestamps);
const earliestDate = new Date(earliestTimestamp);
```

**Result:** Now correctly calculates plazo considering Argentina business days (e.g., Friday → Monday = 3 days).

### 2. Removed "TOTALES DEL DIA" Sidebar ✅

**File:** `frontend/src/components/Processor/ArbitrajesView.jsx`

**Changes:**
- Removed import of `ArbitrageTotals` component
- Removed totals sidebar from layout
- Removed instrument filter (keeping only the main filter)

**Reason:** Move totals to column headers for better space utilization.

---

### 3. Added Totals to Column Headers ✅

**File:** `frontend/src/components/Processor/ArbitrageTable.jsx`

**Changes:**
- Calculate totals from data using `useMemo`
- Display totals directly in P&L column headers:
  - **P&L Trade** header shows total P&L Trade
  - **P&L Caución** header shows total P&L Caución  
  - **P&L Total** header shows grand total
- Totals are color-coded (green for positive, red for negative)

**Benefits:**
- More compact UI
- Totals always visible without scrolling
- Column headers serve dual purpose

---

### 4. Replaced Pattern Text with Pill Badges ✅

**File:** `frontend/src/components/Processor/ArbitrageTable.jsx`

**Changes:**
- Created `renderPatternPills()` function
- Replaced text "Venta CI → Compra 24h" with visual badges:
  - **VentaCI_Compra24h**: Red "CI" pill → Green "24" pill
  - **CompraCIVenta24h**: Green "CI" pill → Red "24" pill

**Visual Format:**
```
Before: "Venta CI → Compra 24h"
After:  [CI] → [24]  (with colored chips)
```

**Colors:**
- Red = Sell
- Green = Buy
- More compact and visually clearer
