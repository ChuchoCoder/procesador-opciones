# Test Suite Cleanup Summary

**Date**: October 13, 2025  
**Branch**: 003-redesign-the-current

## Overview

Cleaned up test suite to focus on high-value integration and smoke tests, removing obsolete tests and temporary debug files that were created during development.

## Files Removed

### Temporary Debug Scripts (5 files)
All temporary `.js` files created for one-time debugging purposes:

1. **`test-full-process.js`** - CSV processing debug script
2. **`test-strike-debug.js`** - Token parsing and strike formatting debug
3. **`tmp-inspect-groups.js`** - Symbol groups inspection script
4. **`test-ggal-config.js`** - Browser console configuration checker
5. **`test-token-parsing.js`** - Token regex testing script

**Reason**: These were created for temporary debugging and validation during development. No ongoing value.

### Obsolete Unit Tests (2 files)

1. **`tests/unit/ggal-october-decimals.spec.js`** (120 lines)
   - **Created for**: Specific GGAL October decimal bug fix
   - **Why obsolete**: 
     - Imports deleted `settings-bridge` module
     - Tests removed `prefixRules` format
     - Functionality now covered by `processor-puts.spec.jsx` integration test
   - **Last purpose**: Validate bridge synchronization (bridge was deleted in legacy system removal)

2. **`tests/unit/config-service.spec.js`** (234 lines)
   - **Created for**: Testing configuration loading/saving
   - **Why obsolete**:
     - Tests `prefixRules` loading/saving (completely removed)
     - Tests sanitization functions (deleted in refactoring)
     - All code being tested was removed in legacy system cleanup
   - **Mock setup**: Heavy mocking of deleted storage module

## Retained Test Suite

### Integration Tests (6 files) - **HIGH VALUE** ✅

These are comprehensive smoke tests that verify complete user workflows:

1. **`processor-flow.spec.jsx`**
   - **Coverage**: Full CSV upload → process → copy → export flow
   - **Value**: End-to-end validation of primary user workflow
   - **Components**: File upload, processing, clipboard, export buttons

2. **`processor-puts.spec.jsx`**
   - **Coverage**: Real GGAL-PUTS.csv fixture processing
   - **Value**: Tests actual production CSV format
   - **Validates**: Symbol detection, expiration mapping, decimal formatting

3. **`processor-groups.spec.jsx`**
   - **Coverage**: Multi-symbol and multi-expiration CSV handling
   - **Value**: Validates symbol/expiration grouping logic
   - **Test cases**: Multiple groups, single group, filtering

4. **`processor-replacements.spec.jsx`**
   - **Coverage**: Symbol replacement/mapping during processing
   - **Value**: Validates configuration-based symbol transformations

5. **`settings-flow.spec.jsx`**
   - **Coverage**: Settings UI workflows (add symbol, configure expirations)
   - **Value**: Validates settings persistence and UI updates

6. **`view-toggle.spec.jsx`**
   - **Coverage**: Raw vs Averaged view switching
   - **Value**: Validates dual-view system and state management

### Core Unit Tests (12 files) - **FOCUSED VALUE** ✅

#### CSV Processing & Business Logic
1. **`process-operations.spec.js`**
   - Core operation processing logic
   - CSV parsing and validation
   - **Keep**: Tests primary business logic

2. **`process-operations.enrichment.spec.js`**
   - Data enrichment and transformation
   - Token parsing and field derivation
   - **Keep**: Critical for data quality

3. **`process-operations.errors.spec.js`**
   - Error handling and edge cases
   - Invalid data scenarios
   - **Keep**: Prevents regressions in error paths

4. **`processor-groups.spec.js`**
   - Group derivation from CSV data
   - Uses real GGAL-PUTS.csv fixture
   - **Keep**: Fast unit-level group testing (no UI overhead)

5. **`averaging-toggle.spec.js`**
   - Raw vs averaged operation calculations
   - Price averaging and quantity aggregation
   - **Keep**: Tests complex business logic without UI

#### Settings & Configuration
6. **`expiration-logic.spec.js`**
   - Suffix validation rules (1-2 chars, uppercase)
   - Symbol configuration persistence
   - **Keep**: Critical validation logic

7. **`storage-settings.spec.js`**
   - localStorage read/write operations
   - Configuration serialization
   - **Keep**: Data persistence layer

8. **`settings-utils.spec.js`**
   - Validation helper functions
   - Data normalization
   - **Keep**: Shared utility functions

9. **`symbol-settings-logic.spec.js`**
   - Symbol-level configuration logic
   - Decimal resolution rules
   - **Keep**: Business rules for settings

#### Export & Output
10. **`clipboard-service.spec.js`**
    - Tab-delimited data formatting
    - Scope-based filtering (CALLS/PUTS/ALL)
    - **Keep**: Output format validation

11. **`export-service.spec.js`**
    - CSV export generation
    - File download handling
    - **Keep**: Export functionality validation

#### UI Components
12. **`operations-table.spec.jsx`**
    - Inferred indicator rendering
    - Minimal component test
    - **Keep**: Fast, focused component test

## Test Execution Improvements

### Before Cleanup
- **Total test files**: 20
- **Obsolete/Debug files**: 7 (35%)
- **Failing tests**: 10 (due to removed code)
- **Maintenance burden**: High (tests for deleted features)

### After Cleanup
- **Total test files**: 18
- **Obsolete/Debug files**: 0
- **High-value integration tests**: 6
- **Focused unit tests**: 12
- **Expected execution time**: Faster (removed slow/failing tests)

## Test Strategy

### Focus on Integration Tests
Integration tests provide the highest ROI:
- ✅ Test complete user workflows
- ✅ Validate all layers working together
- ✅ Catch integration issues
- ✅ Act as smoke tests for releases
- ✅ Closer to real-world usage

### Selective Unit Tests
Unit tests retained for:
- ✅ Complex business logic (averaging, decimal resolution)
- ✅ Validation functions (suffix rules, data normalization)
- ✅ Output formatting (clipboard, export)
- ✅ Fast execution (no UI/browser overhead)

### Avoid Testing
- ❌ Implementation details
- ❌ Removed/deprecated features
- ❌ One-time debugging scenarios
- ❌ Redundant coverage (unit test duplicating integration test)

## Running Tests

```bash
cd frontend
npm test
```

All remaining tests should pass. Integration tests may take 10-15 seconds due to browser rendering, but unit tests are fast (<1 second).

## Next Steps

1. **Fix remaining test failures** (if any after cleanup)
2. **Monitor test execution time** - Target <30 seconds for full suite
3. **Add integration tests** for new features (prioritize over unit tests)
4. **Review test coverage** - Ensure critical paths are covered

## Benefits

✅ **Faster test execution** - Removed slow/failing tests  
✅ **Lower maintenance** - No tests for deleted code  
✅ **Better focus** - High-value integration tests prioritized  
✅ **Cleaner codebase** - No temporary debug scripts  
✅ **Easier CI/CD** - Reliable test suite without known failures
